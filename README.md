# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A *Streamlit-based Movie Recommendation Web App* that suggests movies using *Content-Based Filtering* with *TF-IDF, Tokenization, Lemmatization (NLTK), and Cosine Similarity, along with **Genre-Based Recommendations* and *TMDB API integration* for posters and movie details.

- 🎭 *Genre-Based Recommendations*
- 📄 Detailed Movie Page (Poster, Genres, Overview, Release Date)
- 🎨 Netflix-Style Modern Dark UI
- ⚡ FastAPI Backend Integration
- 🌐 TMDB API for Posters & Metadata
- 📱 Responsive Poster Grid Layout

## 🧠 Recommendation Logic

### 1. Text Pre-Processing (NLP)

Movie overviews/descriptions are cleaned and processed using *Natural Language Processing (NLP)*:

- *Tokenization* – Splitting sentences into words  
- *Lowercasing* – Standardizing text  
- *Stopword Removal* – Removing common words (the, is, and, of…)  
- *Lemmatization (NLTK)* – Converting words to base form  
  - running → run  
  - movies → movie

*Libraries Used*
- nltk
- re (Regular Expressions)
- string

---

### 2. TF-IDF Vectorization

*TF-IDF (Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency)* converts processed text into numerical vectors.

- Highlights important/unique words
- Reduces weight of frequent/common words
- Enables mathematical comparison of movie content

*Library*
- sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer

---

### 3. Cosine Similarity

After TF-IDF vectorization, *Cosine Similarity* measures similarity between two movie vectors.

- *Range:* 0 → 1
- 1 → Highly Similar  
- 0 → Completely Different

*Library*
- sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity

---

### 4. Genre-Based Recommendation

If TF-IDF similarity is limited or unavailable, additional recommendations are generated based on *shared genres* using TMDB metadata.
